I had to see it for myself: the problem
with being so nice when what you have
on your hands is a stalemate crying out
for tough love. Meant to do it for the city
downstream of The City, a bureaucracy
with so many layers I found its excesses
reflected in the gilded tower I was helpless
to note everytime I exited the train station
stepping, without fail into that feeling like
this, is all this really how I want to live now?
Take a walk on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
cutting away from the office through the
breathable light exposing whatever is so
sweet about Front street’s serious throngs;
an ant colony striving in my empty room, late
afternoon. That feeling when dusk comes 
in of: I prefer this place, its air refreshing
my mind before the pilgrimage, until I am
a body in time with the multiplex again, bent
toward the abyssal edge, reducing what is
inside into an iota of where we came from
me. It’s like a Russian doll’s returned me to
my desk, and what’s civil about what’s next
as we take turns smashing the golden weir
holding back our future-great, mythic fish.
