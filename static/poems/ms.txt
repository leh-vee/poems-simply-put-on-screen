I’m poet laureate of this dream
in which, while poised like
a blocked stenographer over 
my keyboard, a khaki fog
drags the mayor’s big feet in,
to see me about how funny
he finds my decree ordering
the city's beautification by
forcing the will of the people
to hang their shoes from the 
electrical wiring called Power
Punchlines, that yes I did 
sort of write as a joke. Look
at them go, on my commute
home, the most unbelievable
lives we’ll never own dangling
just out of reach—like this one.
