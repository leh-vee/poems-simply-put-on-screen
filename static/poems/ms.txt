I'm poet laureate of this dream,
poised with writer's block
like a stenographer over my
shoulder when a khaki fog
drags the mayor’s sneakers in,
to see me about how funny
he finds my decree ordering
the beautification of our city
by forcing everybody to hang
their shoes overhead, from the
electrical wiring called Power
Punchlines, that yes I did sort
of write off as a joke. Look at
them go, during my commute
home; the most unbelievable
lives we’ll never own dangling
just out of reach—like this one.
