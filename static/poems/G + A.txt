I’ve been at this party for longer
than I can remember. It’s not bad
that most everyone likes me but
they don’t know why, so either do
I. It all started with my first steps
out onto the dance floor before
anyone else, having been born
moving on like an emotionally
unavailable man. Women warmed
up to me with a desire I couldn't
comprehend. But when I showed
one what I found most disgusting
about the distance of intimacy, it
turned out she didn’t even want to
be my friend. I’d hoped we’d be out
there together by now, figuring out
how to hold each other. But it’s still
the way it’s always been: girls & boys
on opposite sides of the gym. With
monkey in the middle, dancing as if
I would like to kick all their faces in.
