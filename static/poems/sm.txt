I am the poet laureate
of this dream, and we
see the mayor enter
with a real face on: he
has a problem with me.
Everyone’s gone and
hung their old shoes
from the power lines
it seems; but I meant it
like a joke. If I write
poetry it must be that
I can’t imagine you
taking me so seriously.
Flattered and smiling
down at his feet—New
Balances dragging in
a relaxed, khaki fog,
I resign on the spot.
Others turn up along
my way home, the most
unbelievable lives we’ll
never own, dangling out
of reach like this one.
