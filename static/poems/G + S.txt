I could squeeze him to death,
the man behind the anonymous
hand still grabbing me between
my dumb, white thighs, carrying
me off like a six-pack cinched
in a tight plastic sling, that thing
which affords the articulation of
what, two maybe three piggies
and don’t forget about their little,
fat friend. Whatever they have
wanted these flakes I have had 
to run from and the ones I kept
around for far, far too long, but
to ink their finger-print still deeper
into a snowfall damned to hold
on to their hollows just the same.
