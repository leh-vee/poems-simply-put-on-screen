Like a blocked stenographer
poised over his keys, we wait
for the mayor’s final word on
Power Punchlines : A Decree;
a poem requiring everyone 
to beautify the city by hanging
their old shoes off the wiring
overhead. If heaven were a sky
blue attic she says, calling on
us to make a formal retraction.
So we go, on our way home,
the most unbelievable lives 
ever known, just out of reach.
