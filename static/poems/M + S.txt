I'm the laureate of this dream, 
a blocked stenographer poised
over his key when a khaki fog
drags the mayor’s sneakers
in to see me, about how funny
he finds my decree that orders
the beautification of our city
by forcing everybody to hang
their shoes overhead, from the
electrical wiring called Power
Punchlines, that yes I did sort
of write off as a joke. Look at
them, as I take the long route
home: the most unbelievable
lives we’ll never own dangling
just out of reach—like this one.
