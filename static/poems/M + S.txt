Like a blocked stenographer
poised over her keys we wait
when the mayor enters with
a game face on, to discuss
Power Punchlines : A Decree.
We wrote the idea off as a joke
months ago, how it should look
great if the city was festooned
in everyone’s old pairs of shoes.
News is there’s been an uptick
of sneakers up there, she says:
if heaven were a sky blue attic.
And demands a full retraction
from us very politely. Because
we are the poet of this dream,
when we look down to hide our
smile, we see her New Balances
dragging in a beautiful khaki,
distressed fog. There they go
on our walk home: the most
unbelievable lives we’ll never
own, dangling just out of reach.
